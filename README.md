A small program made to zip and unzip files with support for RAR files later.

## How is it written?
It's written in Python and saved in my .lili text format. It uses Tkinter as it's UI.

## How does it work?

There are three buttons. With the top one you can choose a ZIP or UwU file to unzip or any other file to zip. With the two buttons below you can either zip one or multiple files or you can unzip a ZIP or UwU file.
## What is the UwU format?
It's actually just the ZIP format with a "gamergirl" name. Don't ask me why I did that. I'm bored.
